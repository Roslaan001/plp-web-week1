<p>
The Power Learn Initiative launched the #1Milliondevs4Africa program in April 2022 to make tech skills accessible and affordable to young Africans.

We set out to scale the impact of the program to 5 counties in Kenya, Siaya, Nakuru, Eldoret, & Kiambu. By June 2022, the program had already attracted 863 applicants from across Kenya who were ready to take advantage of this unique opportunity.

By the end of the year, the program had expanded its reach to include South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania, and Nigeria, in pursuit of its goal to make tech skills available throughout the continent.

Currently, we have graduated 1000 students from Kenya, with over 7,000 learners from across our pilot countries enrolled in our unique learning platform.</p>
